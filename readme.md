# Studs.me Anchor Theme

Uses [ntdb's Anchor Tags functions](https://github.com/ntdb/anchor-tags) to use tags in posts.

Custom fields:
- `post_tags` - As above
- `post_sets` - List of sets mentioned in a post, parsed as Brickset links
- `source` - Original source for a linked post (non DF-style linked posts)
